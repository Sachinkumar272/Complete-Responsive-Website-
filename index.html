        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under the command of the government
           at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009,
            free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools 
            to private schools in India is 10:3Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts,
             increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and
              technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the National
               Education Policy 2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the
                National Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil society organizations,
                 academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Shramanas and Brahmanas historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or
           the procurement of funds from students or their guardians.[citation needed] Later, stupas, temples also became centers of education; 
           religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates.
            The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. Arts, crafts, Ayurveda, architecture 
            were taught

            British rule and the subsequent establishment of educational institutions saw the introduction of English as a medium of instruction. 
            Some schools taught the curriculum through vernacular languages with English as a second language. The term "pre-modern" was used for three
             kinds of schools the Arabic and Sanskrit schools which taught Muslim or Hindu sacred literature and the Persian schools which taught
              Persian literature. The vernacular schools across India taught reading and writing the vernacular language and arithmetic.[39] British 
              education became solidified into India as missionary schools were established during the 1820s.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">National Skill Development Agency (NSDA)'s National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), is a quality assurance framework
               which grades and recognises levels of skill based on the learning outcomes acquired through both formal or informal means.[50][51]


               School boards set the curriculum, conduct standardised exams mostly at 10th and 12th level to award the school diplomas. Exams at the remaining levels (also called
                standard, grade or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools.</p>

               <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT): The NCERT is the apex body located at New Delhi, Capital City of India. It makes the curriculum 
                related matters for school education across India.[52] The NCERT provides support, guidance and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees
                 many aspects of enforcement of education policies.[53] There are other curriculum bodies governing school education system specially at state level called SCERTs.
                  State government boards of education: Most of the state governments have at least one "State board of secondary school education". However, some states like Andhra
                   Pradesh have more than one. Also the union territories do not have a board. Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep and Puducherry 
                   Lakshadweep share the services with a larger state. The boards set curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 for affiliated schools. The curriculum varies from state to 
                   state and has more local appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to English often considered less rigorous than national curricula 
                   such as CBSE or ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th level, but some even at the 5th and 8th level.
